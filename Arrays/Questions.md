There are many possible questions or programs related to arrays in C that college professors can ask for internal assessment. Arrays are one of the fundamental data structures in C, and they can be used to store, manipulate, and access multiple values of the same type. Some of the topics that can be covered by array-related questions or programs are:

- Declaring, initializing, and accessing arrays of different types and sizes.
- Passing arrays as arguments to functions and returning arrays from functions.
- Using arrays to implement various algorithms, such as sorting, searching, merging, reversing, etc.
- Using arrays to store and process strings, matrices, and other complex data structures.
- Using pointers and dynamic memory allocation to create and manipulate arrays.
- Using multidimensional arrays to represent tables, grids, images, etc.

Some examples of questions or programs related to arrays in C are:

- Write a program to input an array of n integers from the user and display the sum and average of the elements.
- Write a program to sort an array of n integers in ascending order using bubble sort algorithm.
- Write a program to input two matrices of size m x n and perform their matrix multiplication.
- Write a program to input a string from the user and check whether it is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word that is the same when read forward or backward, such as "madam" or "racecar".
- Write a program to input an array of n integers and a target value from the user and find the index of the target value in the array using binary search algorithm. If the target value is not found, return -1.
- Write a program to input an array of n integers and dynamically allocate a new array of size n that contains the squares of the elements of the original array. Free the memory allocated for the new array after displaying its contents.
- Write a program to input an array of n integers and rotate it by k positions to the right. For example, if the array is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and k is 2, the rotated array should be {4, 5, 1, 2, 3}.
- Write a program to input a two-dimensional array of size m x n and display its transpose. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping its rows and columns.
- Write a program to input an image as a two-dimensional array of pixels and apply a grayscale filter to it. A grayscale filter converts each pixel to a shade of gray by taking the average of its red, green, and blue components.
