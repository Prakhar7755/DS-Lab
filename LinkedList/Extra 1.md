In C, when dealing with linked lists, you may come across function parameters like `struct Node** head` and `struct Node* head`. Let's understand the difference between them:

1. `struct Node* head`:
   - This parameter represents a pointer to the head of the linked list.
   - It is commonly used when you want to pass the head of the linked list to a function and perform operations on it, such as traversing the list or accessing/modifying the elements.
   - It allows you to modify the head pointer itself, making changes visible outside the function.
   - Example: `void traverseLinkedList(struct Node* head);`

2. `struct Node** head`:
   - This parameter represents a pointer to a pointer to the head of the linked list.
   - It is commonly used when you want to modify the head pointer itself, such as when inserting a new node at the beginning or reversing the list.
   - It allows you to modify the head pointer and make the changes visible outside the function.
   - Example: `void insertAtBeginning(struct Node** head, int data);`

Here's a simple explanation of when to use each type:

- Use `struct Node* head` when you need to pass the head pointer to a function for read-only operations or modifications that don't affect the head pointer itself.
- Use `struct Node** head` when you need to pass the head pointer to a function and modify the head pointer itself, such as inserting a new node at the beginning, deleting the head node, or reversing the list.

In summary, `struct Node* head` is used to pass the head pointer for read-only operations or modifications that don't affect the head pointer, while `struct Node** head` is used to pass the head pointer and modify the head pointer itself.
