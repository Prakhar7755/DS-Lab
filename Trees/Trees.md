### DIFFERENT TYPES OF TREES
1. **Tree**: A tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node can have zero or many child nodes⁶⁸⁹.
2. **Binary Tree**: A binary tree is a specialized version of a tree where each node can have at most two children⁶⁸⁹.
3. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A BST is a binary tree where each node's left child is less than the parent node and each node's right child is greater than the parent node¹².
4. **Complete Binary Tree**: A complete binary tree is a binary tree where all levels, except possibly the last, are completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible[^10^]¹¹¹².
5. **Perfect Binary Tree**: A perfect binary tree is a binary tree where all internal nodes have exactly two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level¹¹¹².
6. **AVL Tree**: An AVL tree is a self-balancing BST where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes¹⁵¹⁶.
7. **Heap**: A heap is a special type of complete binary tree where each node's key is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the keys of its children¹².
8. **M-way Search Tree**: An M-way search tree is a tree where each node can have M children.
9. **B Tree**: A B tree is a self-balancing search tree where each node can have more than two children⁷.
10. **B+ Tree**: A B+ tree is an extension of the B tree that stores data pointers only at the leaf nodes and has an additional level with linked leaves at the bottom.
