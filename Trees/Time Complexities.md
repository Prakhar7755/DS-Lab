Here are the time complexities for various operations on different types of trees:

1. **Binary Tree**²:
   - Searching: O(N)
   - Insertion: O(N)
   - Deletion: O(N)
   - Traversal: O(N)⁶

2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**²⁵:
   - Searching: O(h) where h is the height of BST
   - Insertion: O(h)
   - Deletion: O(h)
   - Traversal: O(N)

3. **AVL Tree**¹²:
   - Searching: O(log N)
   - Insertion: O(log N)
   - Deletion: O(log N)
   - Traversal: O(N)

4. **B Tree**¹⁴²²:
   - Searching: O(log N)
   - Insertion: O(log N)
   - Deletion: O(log N)
   - Traversal: O(N)

5. **M way Search Tree (ST)**⁹:
   - Searching: O(log N)
   - Insertion: O(log N)
   - Deletion: O(log N)
   - Traversal: O(N)

6. **B+ Tree**¹⁶²¹:
   - Searching: O(log N)
   - Insertion: O(log N)
   - Deletion: O(log N)
   - Traversal: O(N)

7. **Heap**¹⁸¹⁹[^20^]:
   - Searching: O(N)
   - Insertion: O(log N)
   - Deletion: O(log N)
   - Traversal: O(N)

Please note that these are the average time complexities. The actual time complexity can vary depending on the specific implementation and the state of the tree.
